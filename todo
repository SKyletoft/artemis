Typechecking
	Made the type checker also update all inferred variables to have actual types
Syntax
	allow if {} as if {} else {default}
	arrays
	structs
	enums
	casting
Formatter
Linker
GC

The bad ideas
	Arbirtary base int literals
		1011b2 == 11b10
		ABb16 == 171b10
		34b5 == 19b10

To investigate
	Must all loops be folds?
		Reasonable syntax
			Implicit removal of the fold start value for () returns?
		What new greek letter for the `for` keyword
	Merging basic blocks
		Keep all existing context?
			Keep register counts but not names
	Replace all errors with error messages with a unique enum variant (there's a crate for deriving Error apparently)
