Typechecking
	casting
		Primitives <-> Primitives
		Objects -> Primitives
		Primitives -/> Objects
		Objects -/> Objects
Syntax
	allow if {} as if {} else {default}
	arrays
	structs
	enums
	piping with |> and <|
		two args with ||>?
		map with ]>? ]=?
		fold with `arr ]> default func`?
	partial application with f[x, y] and even f[_, y]
	enforce referential transparency by library design, making everything with a side effect require an environment token (ZST given by the main arguments)
Formatter
Linker
	Just rely on mold for now
GC
	Handle pointers to mid-array

JS backend?

The bad ideas
	Arbirtary base int literals
		1011b2 == 11b10
		ABb16 == 171b10
		34b5 == 19b10

To investigate
	Must all loops be folds?
		Reasonable syntax
			Implicit removal of the fold start value for () returns?
		What new greek letter for the `for` keyword
	Merging basic blocks
		Keep all existing context?
			Keep register counts but not names
	Replace all errors with error messages with a unique enum variant (there's a crate for deriving Error apparently)
